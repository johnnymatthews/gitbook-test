# Hardhat

While originally created for the Ethereum blockchain, the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine runtime (FEVM) allows Hardhat to be used to develop and deploy smart contracts on the Filecoin network.

## Quickstart

The [FEVM Hardhat kit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FEVM-Hardhat-Kit) is a starter hardhat project for developing, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts on the Filecoin network. It functions in the same way as other Hardhat development kits. Check out the quickstart below to test it out!

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the following installed:

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A Filecoin address stored in [MetaMask](../../basics/assets/metamask-setup.md)

### Environment setup

First, we need to grab the starter kit and install the dependencies.

1. Clone the Hardhat starter kit and move into the new `fevm-hardhat-kit` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-hardhat-kit.git
cd fevm-hardhat-kit

# Cloning into 'fevm-hardhat-kit'...
# remote: Enumerating objects: 758, done.
# remote: Counting objects: 100% (725/725), done.
#
# ...
```

2. Use Yarn to install the project‚Äôs dependencies:

```
yarn install

# [1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
# [2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
# [3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
#
# ...
#
# ‚ú®  Done in 16.34s.
```

3. Create an environment variable for your private key. Each wallet has a different process for exporting your private key - check your wallet‚Äôs official documentation.

```sh
export PRIVATE_KEY='<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>'

# For example
# export PRIVATE_KEY='d52cd65a5746ae71cf3d07a8cf392ca29d7acb96deba7d94b19a9cf3c9f63022'
```

4. Always be careful when dealing with your private key. Double-check that you‚Äôre not hardcoding it anywhere or committing it to source control like GitHub. Anyone with access to your private key has complete control over your funds.
5. Get the addresses associated with the private key from Hardhat:

```sh
yarn hardhat get-address

# Ethereum address (this addresss should work for most tools): 0x11Fc070e5c0D32024c9B63c136913405e07C8c48
# f4address (also known as t4 address on testnets): f410fch6aods4buzaete3mpatnejuaxqhzdci3j67vyi
# ‚ú®  Done in 1.40s.
```

Now that we‚Äôve got the kit set up, we can start using it to develop and deploy our contracts.

### Manage the contracts

There are two main types of contracts:

* Basic Solidity examples: Simple contracts to show off basic Solidity.
* Filecoin API Examples: Contracts that demo how to use the Filecoin APIs in Solidity to access storage deals and other Filecoin-specific functions.

Make sure that your account has funds. You won‚Äôt be able to deploy any contracts without `FIL` or `tFIL`.

1. Run `hardhat deploy` to deploy all the contracts. This can take a few minutes:

```sh
yarn hardhat deploy

# Compiled 18 Solidity files successfully
# Wallet Ethereum Address: 0x11Fc070e5c0D32024c9B63c136913405e07C8c48
# Deploying Simplecoin...
# 
# ...
# 
# ‚ú®  Done in 211.76s.
```

2. Interact with the contracts using the available functions within the `tasks` folder. For example, you can get the balance of the `simple-coin` contract by calling the `get-balance` function:

```sh
yarn hardhat get-balance --contract '0xA855520fcCB6422976F7Ac78534edec2379Be5f6' --account '0x11Fc070e5c0D32024c9B63c136913405e07C8c48'

# Reading SimpleCoin owned by 0x11Fc070e5c0D32024c9B63c136913405e07C8c48 on network calibration
# Amount of Simplecoin owned by 0x11Fc070e5c0D32024c9B63c136913405e07C8c48 is 12000
# Total amount of minted tokens is 12000
# ‚ú®  Done in 3.73s.
```
