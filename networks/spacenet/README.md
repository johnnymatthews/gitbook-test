# Spacenet

**Maintainer**: [ConsensusLab](https://consensuslab.world)

Spacenet is not _just_ another Filecoin testnet. It has been modified to run the high-performance [Trantor BFT consensus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir/tree/main/pkg/trantor), implemented atop [Mir](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir), a framework for implementing distributed protocols. And did we forget to mention Spacenet comes with built-in [Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/interplanetary-consensus/overview/) support?

Spacenet aims to provide developers with a testbed to deploy decentralized applications that can benefit from IPCâ€™s capabilities, particularly the ability to deploy and transact in subnets.

To learn more about what you can do on Spacenet, visit the [Interplanetary Consensus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/interplanetary-consensus/overview/) section. For instructions on working with Spacenet, visit the [Spacenet repository](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/spacenet).
